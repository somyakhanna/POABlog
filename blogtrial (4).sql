In 2016, they published a lot of interesting, high-quality posts about various Java topics written by well-known authors like Simon Ritter and Rafael Winterhalter.

Thoughts on Java\r\nI’m mostly writing about JPA and Hibernate on my own blog, and I publish 2-3 new posts every week.

This one is a good read for all advanced Java developers who want to learn more about Java performance and concurrency.\r\n<br>\r\n4. Baeldung<br>\r\nBaeldung is one of the bigger sites in the Java ecosystem. Each month, Eugen and his team publish more than 30 posts about Spring and other Java topics suited for beginners to advanced developers. I always find something new and interesting to read when I visit his site.\r\n<br>\r\nHe also publishes a great weekly newsletter, called the Java Web Weekly. It highlights interesting posts which Eugen and his team found on other websites.\r\n<br>\r\n5. jOOQ<br>\r\nYou might know jOOQ as a framework to define SQL queries, but that’s not the only thing you can find on its website. Lukas Eder also writes a great blog with posts about Java, SQL, and general software development issues like licensing and naming things. If you are a developer who needs to persist data in a relational database, just want to learn more about software development with Java, or like the occasional, well-written rant, you should read Lukas’ blog.\r\n<br>\r\n6. Adam Bien’s Weblog<br>\r\nAdam Bien is a well-known conference speaker, author, and trainer. He is also a prolific blogger who regularly publishes short examples on how to implement certain tasks with Java and Java EE.

RManniBucau v2 Blog<br>\r\nRomain Manni-Bucau is a software engineer at Tomitribe and Committer of the Apache Software Foundation for several Java EE projects.
